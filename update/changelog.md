- Added the secundary function of the axe to place down saplings
- Because of that there are now 2 different modes:
  - Shift-Rightclick into the air to change the mode
  - Mode 1: Rightclick to make farmland; Shift-Rightclick to make grass paths
  - Mode 2: Rightclick to place down torches; Shift-Rightclick to place down saplings instead
- Lexica Botanica support! There's now some in-game text in the Lexica Botanica which explains the new tools added with this mod (closed #5)
- Minor (cough cough) Bugfixes:
  - Switch from "hacky" secundary functions to "real" ones
  - That means that mana will now be drained correctly (closed #2)
  - The tools didn't get damaged/drained mana correctly when destroying blocks with it. That's fixed
  - The AIOT can now be enchanted with sword-specific enchantments as well! (closed #7)
  - Adjusted the durability for the elemtium AIOT (closed #3)
