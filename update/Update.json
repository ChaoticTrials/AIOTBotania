    "0.2": "Added the secundary function of the axe to place down saplings\n \nBecause of that there are now 2 different modes:\n- Shift-Rightclick into the air to change the mode\n- Mode 1: Rightclick to make farmland; Shift-Rightclick to make grass paths\n- Mode 2: Rightclick to place down torches; Shift-Rightclick to place down saplings instead\n \nLexica Botanica support! There's now some in-game text in the Lexica Botanica which explains the new tools added with this mod\n \nMinor (cough cough) Bugfixes:\n- Switch from \"hacky\" secundary functions to \"real\" ones\n- That means that mana will now be drained correctly\n- The tools didn't get damaged/drained mana correctly when destroying blocks with it. That's fixed\n- The AIOT can now be enchanted with sword-specific enchantments as well!\n- Adjusted the durability for the elemtium AIOT",
