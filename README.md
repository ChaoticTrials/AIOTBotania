# aiotbotania
This mod adds AIOTs for Botania tools. Because an AIOT is so much better than just a tool.

This mod adds four new items! That is Hoes and AIOTs (All In One Tool), each as a Manasteel and as an Elementium version.

 

**Manasteel Hoe**:

- tills (corse) dirt and grass (path) by right-clicking, duh!

**Elementium Hoe**:

- same as Manasteel Hoe, but with a nice twist!
- the tilled farmland is wet in an instant and keeps being wet. Forever! (It basically doesn't need any water blocks next to it)
- it can't even be broken by something jumping on it
- therefor, either break the farmland block to get the dirt back or right-click it with the Elementium Hoe (or AIOT) again to turn it back into dirt

**AIOTs**:

- combines almost every aspect of every normal manasteel/elementium tool
- that means you can break almost every block (except for bedrock :P)
- till farmland with the same mechanics as the respective, newly introduced, hoes
- create grass paths by shift right-clicking on dirt or grass, just like a manasteel/elementium shovel
- place torches (on any block that hasn't already a function assigned to it eg. grass, dirt, farmland etc.) just like the manasteel/elementium pickaxe

_Everything is, of course, consuming mana or will get damaged like a vanilla tool if you don't have enough mana._
